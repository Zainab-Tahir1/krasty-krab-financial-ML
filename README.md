# 🐙 Krusty Krab Financial ML 🍔

A **Multi-Themed Financial Machine Learning Application** developed using **Streamlit**. Built by students of BS FinTech (Batch 22), this interactive platform combines real-time stock data analysis, Kragle datasets, and machine learning models with engaging visual themes to make finance both fun and functional.

## 🎯 Objective

This project was developed as part of the **AF3005 – Programming for Finance** course under the supervision of **Dr. Usama Arshad**. The goal was to create a unified, interactive Streamlit application featuring:
- Multiple machine learning workflows
- Distinct visual themes per contributor
- Real-time stock analysis
- Financial data modeling using Kragle datasets

---


## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Implemented

Each theme implements a unique ML algorithm:
- **Linear Regression** (e.g., stock price forecasting)
- **Logistic Regression** (e.g., binary outcome classification)
- **K-Means Clustering** (e.g., unsupervised financial pattern analysis)

With evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy, R² Score, MSE, Silhouette Score
